## About Me

I am currently a Biostatistician at Roche and a part-time Statistical Consultant at Yale University. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow working with Dr. Donna Spiegelman and Dr. Laura Forastiere in the Center for Methods in Implementation and Prevention Science (CMIPS), Yale School of Public Health.

I obtained my Ph.D. in Biostatistics from the University of Waterloo, supervised by [Dr. Grace Y. Yi](https://www.uwo.ca/stats/people/bios/Yi,%20Grace.html). My thesis was awarded the [Pierre Robillard Award in Canada, 2021](https://ssc.ca/en/awards/2021/junhan-fang-pierre-robillard-award-2021), recognizing the best Ph.D. thesis in probability and statistics defended in Canada.

I received my Master of Science in Public Health (Biostatistics) from Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, and my B.A. in Statistics from Southwestern University of Finance and Economics.
