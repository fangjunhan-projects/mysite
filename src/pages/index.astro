    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am currently a Biostatistician at Roche and a part-time Statistical Consultant at Yale University. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow working with Dr. Donna Spiegelman and Dr. Laura Forastiere in the Center for Methods in Implementation and Prevention Science (CMIPS), Yale School of Public Health.
    </p>
    <p>
      I obtained my Ph.D. in Biostatistics from the University of Waterloo, supervised by <a href="https://www.uwo.ca/stats/people/bios/Yi,%20Grace.html">Dr. Grace Y. Yi</a>. My thesis was awarded the <a href="https://ssc.ca/en/awards/2021/junhan-fang-pierre-robillard-award-2021">Pierre Robillard Award in Canada, 2021</a>, recognizing the best Ph.D. thesis in probability and statistics defended in Canada.
    </p>
    <p>
      I received my Master of Science in Public Health (Biostatistics) from Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, and my B.A. in Statistics from Southwestern University of Finance and Economics.
